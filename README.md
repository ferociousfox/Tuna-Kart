# Tuna-Kart

Group Project, Week5 of CSS
Tuna-Kart is a typing game inspired by the classic Mario-Kart Nintendo game. Our game features our teacher, Tyler Suderman, as the protagonist kart-racer. Tyler is racing against 2 other bad guys-- Vin Diesel and Newman (from Seinfeld). First kart-racer across the finish line wins and gains all the glory!

### Game Instructions

Click on "Start Game!" to initiate the typing game. A word will appear at the center of the screen; the user types out this word as fast as they can.  Every letter the user gets correct Tyler's kart will move forward 60px toward the finish line.

Tyler's foes, Vin and Newman, are propelled toward the finish line using JavaScript. On the easy level Vin and Newman move slower. On more difficult levels they move faster.
